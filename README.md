# Global Terrorism Dataset

## Overview

The **Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD)** is a comprehensive database that tracks the details of terrorist events around the world. It covers incidents from 1970 to the present day, providing detailed information on attacks, perpetrators, targets, and outcomes. This dataset serves as an essential resource for understanding the trends and patterns of global terrorism, analyzing the socio-political impact of terrorist activities, and conducting research on counter-terrorism strategies.

The dataset contains millions of records and can be used for a wide variety of analyses, including statistical modeling, machine learning, and geopolitical studies. It includes various features such as the date, location, attack type, weapons used, casualties, and more.

## Key Features

- **Incident Information**: Each record corresponds to a specific terrorist event, including details about the attack such as date, location, and event type.
- **Terrorist Group Information**: The dataset includes information on terrorist groups responsible for the attacks.
- **Casualties**: Records the number of fatalities and injuries in each incident.
- **Target Types**: Identifies the type of target (e.g., civilian, military, government).
- **Attack Method**: Specifies the tactics or weapons used (e.g., bombings, shootings, hijackings).
- **Location Details**: Provides geographical data about the incident, including country, region, and city.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset contains multiple columns, including but not limited to the following:

- `event_id`: Unique identifier for each attack
- `date`: Date of the attack
- `country`: Country where the attack took place
- `region`: Geopolitical region (e.g., Middle East, Europe)
- `city`: The city or location of the attack
- `attack_type`: The type of attack (e.g., bombing, armed assault)
- `fatalities`: The number of deaths caused by the attack
- `injuries`: The number of people injured
- `group_name`: Terrorist group or entity responsible for the attack
- `target_type`: Type of target (e.g., military, civilian, government building)

## Usage

This dataset can be used for:

- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in global terrorism over time, such as rising or falling incidents in particular regions.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualize the geographic spread of terrorist activities.
- **Risk Assessment**: Help governments and organizations assess regions with high risk of terrorist activities.
- **Modeling & Prediction**: Build machine learning models to predict future terrorist events or analyze factors that correlate with terrorism.
- **Policy Making**: Assist policymakers and researchers in understanding the socio-political impacts of terrorism.

## Requirements

To use the dataset effectively, you may need the following tools:

- Python (for analysis using libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive analysis)
- SQL (if working with the dataset in a database)
- GIS Software (for mapping geographical data)

## Installation

If you're using this dataset in a Python environment, you can install the necessary libraries:
